Docker image hosting Neo4j Database of [StackExchange sites](https://stackexchange.com/sites). Since data volume is large, site selection is dictated by environment variable `SE_ARCHIVE_7Z_URL`. URL can be retrieved from [this anonymized dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) of Stack Exchange network. Default url points to the archive of `windowsphone.stackexchange.com` (yes I love beating dead horses :)).
